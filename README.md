# Survey-Analysis

Survey Analysis is a working project that analyses and summarises survey data. It can:
- Parse .csv files to collect survey responses and translate the text to numbers
- Generate pivot tables for responses to questions
- Generate linear regressions between two given variables
- Generate significant statistical values, from the Spearman coefficient to measures of central tendency.

In the future, Survey Analysis will:
- Format the outputted analyses that make it easier to put into other documents
- Create more methods for customisable summary outputs
- Include an example of a possible workflow using Survey Analysis.
